To wrap up I would mention why after everything that has been explained I consider that Quake (or a Quake style game) can't be at the top of eSports again.\\

Besides that, it will contain some personal notes about the importance of this old and almost forgotten games. In some cases even unknown to new young players coming into eSports. After commenting on the monstrous growth that eSports had in the last 20 years going from nothing to the huge movement that it is, some credit should be given to games like Quake.\\

A curious like of thought could also be included about how when a medium gets big enough the things considered the best are not the most popular any more. There are a lot of interesting analogies, a good one would be with music. There was a time when bands could be at the same time considered the best and the most popular (Led Zeppelin?) but then Pop music was created. Pop (from popular) music is specifically designed to be, well, popular while not necessarily being the best. In the same way, there are games considered better than other games that are more popular in the eSports scene, and it is the case that the latter are better suited and designed to be popular, watchable, enjoyable for casual players, etc.\\
