\FutureContentNotes{
This section will mainly contain the events that happened between the year 1997 and the beginning of the new millennium. How and why these events happened and started sets a good framework to then go into detail in section \ref{sec::reasoning}.\\

Besides commenting on the facts about the events themselves in chronological order some extra comments analysing interesting phenomena will be added. A good example would be how, especially in the first few years, Quake was not actually "picked" as the game to become the eSport but it was originated from Quake fans wanting to compete so they created the tournaments, selecting which game will be in the tournaments was not even considered, they were very passionate Quake fans (and usually only played that game), so the choice was obvious (there really was nothing to choose).\\

In that era there were not factors like what game is the most marketable, how big is the fan-base or the hype, is it relevant for sponsors, do crowds want to watch it, can it get good venues or is this good for the future of my event. Most of those would be against Quake being chosen as a big eSports game right now, but then they were not relevant.\\

When commenting on the final years of Quake as the big eSports game we will mention how the biggest percentage of the public left the game to focus on others like \textit{Counter-Strike} \citep{game:cs} much in the same what that tournament organizers did (remarkably the CPL switching to \textit{Counter-Strike} \citep{game:cs} as the main game in the year 2000).\\

A possible approach is divide it by games: \textit{Quake}, \textit{Quake II} and \textit{Quake III}.\\

Some events that deserve mention are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Red Annihilation
	\item All the CPL events (1997-2000) \citep{web:cpl}
	\item All QuakeCon events (merged once with CPL in 1998).
\end{itemize}

A good approach could be to note what came new with each game and relate how the games improved in each iteration and how the community also grew too the size and recognition of all the events that deserve to and will be mentioned.\\
